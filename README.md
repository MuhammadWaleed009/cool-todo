## Welcome to my super To-Do app

### How to run it

1. Initialize your environment: 
  - `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. Install dependencies: `source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python manage.py runserver`


### Exercise

The task is this: spend about 30 minutes (more if you choose, that's totally up to you) building a simple task tracker API (todo list), preferably functional (It can also just be pseudo-code). There are no hidden tricks, we just want you to express yourself in code.

You can implement it and share your solution with us before or during the interview. Or if you prefer live collaboration session with the team, you can also lead the team to implement the app during your interview.

### Instructions

- Clone/download the repo
- Create a branch for your solution
- Implement your solution. Note that we have given you some starter setup. Feel free to change it however you want
- Create a pull request for your solution
